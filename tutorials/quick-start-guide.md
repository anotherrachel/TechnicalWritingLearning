# Quick Start Guides

## Components of a Quickstart Guide

**Know what you want the guide to accomplish**

> What Will Your Quick-Start Guide Do?
>
> * Help your user learn about your product?
> * Tell your user how to do the series of steps required to get started?
> * Tell your user how to do a single task?

1. Learn-Abut Guide (A conceptual guide)
   * introduces the main concepts of your product, process, or tool.

2. Procedural Guide
   * tells the users how to do the series of steps required to get started with your product, process, or tool.
   * lists the steps you should complete before you begin using the product or service.
   * write a procedural guide if your users must complete the series of steps in a particular way or if they wouldn't know what the getting started steps are unless you tell them.

3. Steps-You-Must-Take-in-This-Order Guide (Task-specific procedural guide)
   * explains to the user how to take specific steps in a specific order.
   * notices the use of numbers and the arrangement of steps which show that there's a specific sequence of tasks required to complete the goal.

> Though some quick start guides are a blend of conceptual and procedural,each guide should have a single overall purpose.

**List steps: Sequence or separate tasks?**

> Are there steps my user must take to get started or are there tasks my user may want to complete? **Must or may, that is the question.** And your answer to that question will enable you to develop the structure for your guide.

1. Blend procedural information and description (Dual Information Presentation)
   * but make sure the user quickly see the overall purpose of your guide.

2. Tips for presenting the two types of information in one quick-start guide.
   1. Create distinct sections
   2. Provide conceptual information and insert supporting procedural steps under each concept

**Incorporate visuals into your Quickstart guide**

1. Drawing and Exploded Drawing

   * depicts an item two ways, in its assembled state and in a state with all of its components separated
   * helps users understand the separation points and visualize just where each piece goes.

2. Flowchart
   * how a process works

3. Annotated Screenshot
   * uses markings to draw the user's attention to details in the image itself.
   * helpsthe user know what to look at in the image and they correspond to the focus of a specific step or task.
     * helpful when it's hard to describe in words

   > **Annotation Best Practices**
   >
   > 1. Be consistent
   > 2. Use numbers to indicate a series
