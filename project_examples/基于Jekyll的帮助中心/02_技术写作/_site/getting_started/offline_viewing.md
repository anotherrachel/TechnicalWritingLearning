# offline viewing

This theme uses relative links throughout so that you can view the site offline and not worry about which server or directory you’re hosting it. It’s common with tech docs to push content to an internal server for review prior to pushing the content to an external server for publication. Because of the need for seamless transferrence from one host to another, the site has to use relative links.

To view pages locally on your machine (without the Jekyll preview server), they need to have the `.html`extension. The `permalink` property in the page’s frontmatter (without surrounding slashes) is what pushes the files into the root directory when the site builds.
