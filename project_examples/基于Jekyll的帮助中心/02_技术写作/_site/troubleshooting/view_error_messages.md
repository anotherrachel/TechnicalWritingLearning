There are two main types of Jekyll build error messages.

**"Page build warning"** - Your build completed just fine, but there's something we think you ought to know.

**"Page build failed"** - Your build failed to complete. If we are able to detect the specific error, we will send you a descriptive error message with a link to supporting documentation. If we are not able to detect a specific error with your page build failure, then you will receive a generic "page build failed" error message.

# View  by email

You can view all Jekyll build error messages by email if you have your email set up. 

> **Note:** Generic build failures will not produce an email with specific file and error information. If you receive an email that simply says "Page build failed" with no further details, or your GitHub Pages site is not showing up after the first push, check for [Generic build failures](generic_build_failures.md). 

# View in your repo

You can view Jekyll build failure messages in the repository settings of your GitHub Pages site.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.
3. Under GitHub Pages you can see current Jekyll build failure messages.

> **Note:** Page build warnings will not display in your repository settings.

# View in the command line

It's strongly recommended that running Jekyll locally so you can easily debug and fix build errors before pushing to GitHub. 

To view all Jekyll build error messages on the command line, you must set up your Jekyll site locally on your computer. If your page isn't building after you push to GitHub, see [Page build failures](page_build_failures.md).
