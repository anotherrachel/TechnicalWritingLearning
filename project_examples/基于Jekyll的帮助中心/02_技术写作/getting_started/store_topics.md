<h1 id="title1">Storing your documentation topics</h1>

You can store your files for each product inside subfolders following the pattern shown in the theme. For example, product1, product2, etc, can be stored in their own subfolders inside the _pages directory. Inside _pages, you can store your topics inside sub-subfolders or sub-sub-folders to your heartâ€™s content. When Jekyll builds your site, it will pull the topics into the root directory and use the permalink for the URL.

Note that product1, product2, and mydoc are all just sample content to demonstrate how to add multiple products into the theme. You can freely delete that content.
